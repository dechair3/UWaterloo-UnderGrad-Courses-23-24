It takes a modelled approach to teaching learning strategies to students who struggle to meet the demands of a university curriculum. In the lectures, students will be taught various learning strategies that they will be able to apply to successfully meet the demands of their other courses. Students will then apply these modelled strategies in their other courses during a weekly application lab. Students will be expected to demonstrate their understanding of the material through a variety of assignments. The course will include an engineering component. ",
