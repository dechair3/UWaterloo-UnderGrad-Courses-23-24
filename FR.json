The Department of French Studies reserves the right to refuse admission to, and/or credit for, any of its language courses to a student who has, in the view of the Department, a level of competence unsuited to that course.\nStudents may not be enrolled in two first-year French courses at the same time; they will be denied credit for all lower-level, first-year French courses taken during that term and will only receive credit for the highest-level course.\nStudents may not backtrack to a lower-year language course after having taken a higher-level one (i.e., students who have completed FR 251 and/or 252 may not go back and later enrol in FR 192B, 192A, 152, 151, or 101).\nStudents with XX transferred university credits in French (e.g., FR 1XX) or who haven't taken French for more than three years must consult the Department before enrolling in any French courses.\nBasic placement rules:\n        \nNo previous experience in French: FR 101\nElementary and Grade 9 core: FR 151\nGrade 10 core: FR 151\nGrade 11 core: FR 152\nGrade 12 core or 4U: FR 192A\nGrade 12 extended and immersion French: FR 192B\nFrancophone students and students having graduated from a French high school must have the written permission of the Department to enrol in any French courses.\nStudents may enrol in courses for which they have secondary school antirequisites only with the written permission of the Department.",
